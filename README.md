# Hotel-Management-System
This is a Hotel Management System Console Based Project made using SpringBoot. The Database used is MySql.
# When the application starts, the Customer has two options:
To log in and Register
To just View All the Room Details.
To Book a Room.
While booking the room, the customer is asked for the room number in which he is interested. Then, the following room's availability is checked and the following room is assigned to him. The customer is also asked for his personal details and a ID is generated with which he can check in the hotel and is then stored in a database.
The Customer Login asks for Room number and customer's  which are first validated and then allows the Customer to access the Room.
If the Customer wishes to check, Customer can access this Feature by logging out.
